# Laptop Stand V17

An original design by Fabrico.Labs created as a novel, functional merchandise for marketing of Pecunia.Finance DAO.

## Description

This model features a simple triangular structure which leverages the bottom edge of a laptop against the bracing arm situated 45 Degrees, perpendicular to the main arm which lies flush against the back of the laptop.

The bracing arm is separate from the main arm but held in place by the curvature of the upper end of the bracing arm sitting in a divet of the main arm. Where the main arm and brace arm meet the base, there are [compliant mechanisms](https://www.compliantmechanisms.byu.edu/) which allow the arms to be bent into a compact form. The potential energy is stored in the plastic and returns the model to its functional form when released.

Two models must be printed to complete the set.
