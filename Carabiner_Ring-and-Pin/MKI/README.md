# Carabiner Ring-&-Pin MKI 'Hole'

An original design by Fabrico.Labs created as a novel, functional merchandise for marketing of Pecunia.Finance DAO.

## Description

A printable carabiner in the style of a [annular brooch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooch) which leverages the strengths of [FDM](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_Deposition_Modeling) to create a strong ring which can be used for light-weight, cosmetic purposes such as:

- keyring
- decoration
- backpack strap buckle
- etc.

```
DO NOT USE THIS CARABINER FOR CLIMBING OR LIFTING HEAVY WEIGHT. MAXIMUM LOAD HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED OR EVEN TESTED. FOR DECORATIVE PURPOSES ONLY.
```

## Materials

### Filament

- PETG-Carbon-Fiber (**Recommended**)
- PETG

### Additional Materials

#### Keyring

The hole design (MKI & MKIII) is based upon common, commercially available, wire keychains.

- These usually have a 4M / 4mm OD screw

#### Metal Insert

Using a metal insert to [re-enforce the hole](#mki-hole) is advisable, as cordage/wire will rub away the plastic over time

## General Print Settings

The following are generally recommended settings and parameters for printing this part.

### Temperatures

- PETG-CF
  - Print Temp.: 250-255 C
  - Bed Temp.: 72 C
- PETG
  - Print Temp.: 240-247 C
  - Bed Temp.: 70 C

### Adhesion

No adhesion support is necessary **as long as the bed is leveled**.

### Support

- Type: Normal
- Placement: Everywhere
- Density: 10%
- X/Y Distance: 0.4-1mm

## Additional Details

A 4mm diameter hole is centered in the pin, just at the inside edge of the ring. Threading a chain, wire, or other cordage through the hole will prevent the pin from dislodging far enough to open the center pin-lock.

To extend the life of this print, a metal tube insert (see additional materials below) can be sunk into the hole in the pin using a soldering iron set to 200-250 degrees Celecius, based on the quality/accuracy of the soldering iron.

### Additional Materials

The following materials are **optional**:

- 4mm ID (max. 6mm OD/Width) x 5mm Height/Length metal (steel) bead, tube, or insert.
- Soldering Iron (min. 260 degrees Celcius)

### Unique Print Settings

- No supports needed, but recommended.
