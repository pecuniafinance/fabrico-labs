## Additional Details

This iteration of the MKII Clip design features a horizontal space in the pin, so that a separately printed mono-arm-arc can be inserted. Reasons include:
- Printing the arms in a material different to the material of the pin.
- Replacing the arms if broken, worn, or lost.

### Unique Print Settings
- Supports are highly recommended within the ring and pin, to ensure the space for the pin's arms will not require significant post-processing.

**Note:** Spacing between models are 0.3mm apart to account for thermal expansion and tolerance of printing accuracy.
