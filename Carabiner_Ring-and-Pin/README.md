# Carabiner Ring-&-Pin

An original design by Fabrico.Labs created as a novel, functional merchandise for marketing of Pecunia.Finance DAO.

## Description

A printable carabiner in the style of a [annular brooch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooch) which leverages the strengths of [FDM](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_Deposition_Modeling) to create a strong ring which can be used for light-weight, cosmetic purposes such as:
- keyring
- decoration
- backpack strap buckle
- etc.

```
DO NOT USE THIS CARABINER FOR CLIMBING OR LIFTING HEAVY WEIGHT. MAXIMUM LOAD HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED OR EVEN TESTED. FOR DECORATIVE PURPOSES ONLY.
```

## Materials

### Filament
- PETG-Carbon-Fiber (**Recommended**)
- PETG (*optional*)

### Additional Materials

#### Keyring
The hole design (MKI & MKIII) is based upon common, commercially available, wire keychains.
- These usually have a 4M / 4mm OD screw

#### Metal Insert
Using a metal insert to [re-enforce the hole](#mki-hole) is advisable, as cordage/wire will rub away the plastic over time

    - Print Temp.: 240-247 C
    - Bed Temp.: 70 C

### Adhesion
No adhesion support is necessary **as long as the bed is leveled**.

### Support
- Type: Normal
- Placement: Everywhere
- Density: 10%
- X/Y Distance: 0.4-1mm

## Versions
- [MKI Hole](#mki-hole)
- [MKII Clip](#mkii-clip)

### MKI 'Hole'

A 4mm diameter hole is centered in the pin, just at the inside edge of the ring. Threading a chain, wire, or other cordage through the hole will prevent the pin from dislodging far enough to open the center pin-lock.

To extend the life of this print, a metal tube insert (see additional materials below) can be sunk into the hole in the pin using a soldering iron set to 200-250 degrees Celecius, based on the quality/accuracy of the soldering iron.

#### Additional Materials
The following materials are **optional**:
- 4mm ID (max. 6mm OD/Width) x 5mm Height/Length metal (steel) bead, tube, or insert.
- Soldering Iron (min. 260 degrees Celcius)

#### Unique Print Settings
- No supports needed, but recommended.

### MKII 'Clip'

The pin has arms which form a [compliant mechanism](https://www.compliantmechanisms.byu.edu/), allowing the pin to lock into place with an audible snapping sound and then be released again by manipulating the arms. There are no moving parts, only bending.

#### Pin Removal Instructions

Both hands must be used to remove the pin. Perform the following steps to remove the pin:
1. Orient the ring with the part of the pin protruding from the ring pointing toward you and downwards.
2. Place both hands on the ring, like a steering wheel.
3. Pry the ends of the arms out and downwards, by using your fingernails.

**Note:** If no fingernails available, use a small thin blade, key-tip, flat-head screwdriver, etc. to pry the arms into release position while pushing/pulling downwards on the pin.

#### Unique Print Settings
- Support Z Distance: 0.1mm or simply ensure that supports are created for the pin's arms, which are ~0.4mm (or two layers) higher than the bottom of the pin.
- Supports are highly recommended within the ring, to ensure the space for the pin's arms will not require significant post-processing.

**Note:** Spacing between models are 0.3mm apart to account for thermal expansion and tolerance of printing accuracy.
