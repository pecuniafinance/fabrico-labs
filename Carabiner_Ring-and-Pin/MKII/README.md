## Description

A printable carabiner in the style of a [annular brooch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooch) which leverages the strengths of [FDM](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_Deposition_Modeling) to create a strong ring which can be used for light-weight, cosmetic purposes such as:
- keyring
- decoration
- backpack strap buckle
- etc.

## Additional Details

The pin has arms which form a [compliant mechanism](https://www.compliantmechanisms.byu.edu/), allowing the pin to lock into place with an audible snapping sound and then be released again by manipulating the arms. There are no moving parts, only bending.

### Pin Removal Instructions

Both hands must be used to remove the pin. Perform the following steps to remove the pin:
1. Orient the ring with the part of the pin protruding from the ring pointing toward you and downwards.
2. Place both hands on the ring, like a steering wheel.
3. Pry the ends of the arms out and downwards, by using your fingernails.

**Note:** If no fingernails available, use a small thin blade, key-tip, flat-head screwdriver, etc. to pry the arms into release position while pushing/pulling downwards on the pin.

### Unique Print Settings
- Support Z Distance: 0.1mm or simply ensure that supports are created for the pin's arms, which are ~0.4mm (or two layers) higher than the bottom of the pin.
- Supports are highly recommended within the ring, to ensure the space for the pin's arms will not require significant post-processing.

**Note:** Spacing between models are 0.3mm apart to account for thermal expansion and tolerance of printing accuracy.
